-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It contains 1368 images(1096 for training and 272 for validation)

Dataset is about 10 monkey species

Main aim is to classify the monkey species basing on images using different algorithms

Algorithms used:
----------------
1) CNN through transfer learning using VGG16
2) LinearSVM
3) Random Forest
4) SVM
5) knn (with k=5,7 and k= 1 to 25)
6) Decision tree
7) Naive bayes classifier
